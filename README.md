# ðŸ§­ Jetpack Compose Type-Safe Navigation  (No Parameters)
This is a **minimal Android app** built using **Jetpack Compose** to learn and demonstrate **Type-Safe Navigation** without passing parameters.

## ðŸ“š What is Type-Safe Navigation?
Type-safe navigation lets you define your navigation routes as **Kotlin classes**, not just strings. This helps avoid errors like:
- Typos in route names
- Wrong argument types
- Missing parameters

With type-safe navigation, everything is checked **at compile time**.


## ðŸŽ¯ What This App Demonstrates

-  Setting up Navigation with `NavController` and `NavHost`
-  Creating navigation routes using sealed classes
-  Navigating between screens without parameters
-  Using `composable<Screen>()` to define destinations
